    "This is our workspace for collaborative filtering and content based music generation.\n",
    "For spotify API, reference this page for [setup](https://medium.com/@benfenison/using-spotify-web-api-w-python-6b31a328b26e) and this page for [documentation](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy). Data for the content base filtering was collected [here](https://grinslade.pythonanywhere.com).\n",

    "## The Problem\n",
    "Our project was focused on the pratical everyday issue that music listeners struggle to find new songs that they would *actually* listen to. There are many manys to solve this problem, but the most common way that is used in this industry is collaborative filtering. Collaboraive filtering has been done by Spotify, Netflix and many others for recommendations to their users. Collaborative filtering is an algorithm that dictates what users are similar and then suggest content that the similar users enjoy. Another method commonly used in pratice is Content-based filtering. This algorithm simply decides if a user's liked content is similar to other content based off its metadata or attributes then suggests this content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach\n",
    "Our approach to this problem similar but with our own implementation. More specifically, we would create two ways of generating suggested songs: Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. We would implement these algorithms in our own way and compare it to established generations like Spotify's. We decided we would look at user data to generate 5 songs that the listener would truly enjoy.\n",

    "This is our implementation for content-based filtering. Our derivation goes through each song in our database (~615 songs). For each of the songs we calculate the difference between the user's top tracks and the database song audio features. if the difference falls with in the user's general standard deviation of each audio we add a \"point\" to the like-ability for the song. These audio features are danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence and tempo. Finally, we would suggest the five songs with the highest like-ability for the user. We decided to take the standard deviation of each audio feature since each is on its own scale and we only want to add a point if it is similar to what the user listens to. If a user has a large variety of music they listen to it would be reflected in a wide standard deviation for each of the audio features. "

    "The content-based filtering we implemented took the current user's top 20 songs and calculated the averages of each attribute. If a song from the database's attribute  fell within the standard deviation of the user's songs then one point would be awarded, out of a eleven. Finally, after normalizing the data, the top 5 songs with the most points would be suggested the user. Spotify's suggestion algorithm is not made public. For the purpose of these experiments, we used spotify's API to generate five suggested songs given the user's top song.\n",

It would have been interesting to see how succesful our content-based algorithm would have been depending on small adjustments we would have made. For example, would our alogrithm be more succesful if we how less similar songs so that our users have a more diverse set of suggestions? What if we compare each top track of the user to the database of songs instead of using the averages of all the user's top 20 tracks so that the user could have a variety of suggestion instead of a generalization?"

We begin organizing the data in a way that is easy to manage. We begin by creating a dataframe that contains all the information we need. In this implementation we create a large dictionary that stores profiles on each of the users found in the dataset. In these profiles we have a list of tuples, where the tuples contain the song title as well as the amount of times the song was listened to  by the specific user. This portion of the code is directly below and takes a few minutes to run. Then, when given a specific user to recommend to, we score every other user(potential partner) in relation to the given user. Everytime we get a match on a song we increase the potential partner's core by 1 * the number of times the song was listend to by the user. We do this because not all songs are created equally, we like some more than others. We then grab the potential partner with the highest score and look at their top five most listened to songs and remove all matching songs that the user has already listened to and add the next highest to replace it. We then recommend these unique top five songs to our user.  "

Immediately under our table we have code that displays the users (shortened), an input box for which user you want a recommendation to, then after our code is ran (few seconds), You will have two lists given to you. The first one is a list of all the songs the given user has listened to with the number of times the song has been played and the artist name. The way accuracy was determined was creating an identical playlist on spotify to what our user had. Then viewing the recommendations given by spotify we would see if one of our recommendations match. We refresh the recommendation list another two times to have a total of 3 recommendation lists."
